      <title>Spring Boot Actuator Health Endpoint</title>

      <description>Health endpoint for a service exposes status of it&amp;rsquo;s state. This state information is useful to determine whether the application is up and ready to accept requests. Normally when a service is fronted by a Load Balancer, the loadbalancer uses the information derived from the health endpoint to decide whether to route traffic to that instance of service or not. Spring Boot actuator provides Health Endpoint out of the box. If we add spring-boot-actuator dependency we can get the URI /actuator/health.</description>

      <title>Resilience4j, the path beyond Hystrix</title>

      <description>Introduction
In discussions of cloud-native applications or microservices, the theme that takes a center stage is Resiliency. Hystrix from Netflix OSS has been the go-to library for developers to implement resiliency patterns, in many cases, it&amp;rsquo;s integration with other application frameworks like Spring, Micronaut has made the developer life easier. However, Hystrix has been put into maintenance mode and Spring cloud 2020.0.0 (aka Ilford) has stopped its support for Hystrix. This is a huge change, what&amp;rsquo;s the migration path ahead, what is the alternative?</description>

      <description>Resilience4j
This work I deep dive into resilience4j which is an alternative to Hystrix. Resilience4j is a lightweight fault tolerance library and a possible alternative to Hystrix. Resilience4j comes with following core modules -
  resilience4j-circuitbreaker: Circuit breaking
  resilience4j-ratelimiter
  resilience4j-bulkhead
  resilience4j-retry
  resilience4j-timelimiter
  resilience4j-cache
  one can also stacked together combinations of different resiliency patterns. It also comes with spring-boot starter.</description>

      <description>Welcome to The Weekly Journal. Here I will try to compile link,blogposts etc which I read that week. This week I will start with a little look back on 2020.
2020 like everyone else I remained constantly worrying, but I did manage to read some books and try out few things as follows
  12 week a year - I can say till now the most influencing blinks that I read.</description>

      <title>Spring Under the hood-Inside Feign and client side discovery with consul</title>
      <link>https://njoysubho.github.io/posts/consul-feign/</link>

      <guid>https://njoysubho.github.io/posts/consul-feign/</guid>
      <description>Feign using consul as discovery service is easy to setup thanks to Spring Autoconfigurations, but let&amp;rsquo;s see how this magic is actually done -
Spring cloud open feign comes with FeignLoadBalancerAutoConfiguration . If we see closely it imports three more LoadBalancerAutoConfigurations
  HttpClientFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration, OkHttpFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration, DefaultFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration
  If classpath has Apache http client then it uses HttpClientFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration , if path has Ok http client then it uses OkHttpFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration otherwise uses it DefaultFeignLoadBalancerConfiguration which in turn uses Apache Http client.</description>

  But we may need to use this. Jaba use wildcard concept
  Producrer extends and consumer super

      <description>AWS Lambda is the serverless offering from amazon. In serverless the provider is responsible for settung up a runtime as and when needed for the deployed application/function to run. Typically these are small functions which are quick to start up and finish their task. Lambdas when invoked, has a small startup overhead. This startup overhead involves fetching the function artifact from S3 , setting up networking, starting up the application. Java applications often suffer from this cold start up problem , and depends on application this can go up quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Spring Boot Actuator Health endpoint since 2.3.0 comes with two health groups Liveness and Readiness. Actuator Health points are being used to reflect the status of the application. Spring Boot also provides a way to add multiple health indicators together and form a group. As a continuation to this concept Spring Boot provides two HealthIndicator LivenessStateIndicator and ReadinessStateIndicator. These two indicators are added to liveness and readiness group respectively by AvailabilityProbesHealthEndpointGroups.</description>

      <title>Deploy EKS Kubernetes Cluster with fargate</title>

      <description>EKS is managed kubernetes service by AWS. This post will describe networking setup for EKS cluster.
EKS have two options public cluster and private-public cluster. In the public cluster all nodes get a public IP and they can access internet traffic and vice versa.
In public-private scheme nodes are all in private subnet and services are exposed via Loadbalancers in public subnet.
We will see network configuration about public-private scheme. Below is the conceptual design of the cluster</description>

      <description>In order to explore more about deploying on ECS using terraform and github action I created a small project but as I try to deploy it on AWS ECS I found some interesting issue.
 So I created a services in a subnet , the subnet has rule that route all internet traffic to an internet gateway. The service has a simple task. I created all the infrastructure using terraform and deployed using github.</description>

      <title>Traceid Logging with Micronaut</title>

      <description>Distributed tracing is must have when we create our microservices . Frameworks like Spring Boot,Micronaut comes with the support of creating TraceId,SpanId and propagate to visualization tools like Zipkin,Jaegar . This post shortly describe what we need to add in order to log the TraceId in application or access log . Logging traceId helps us in correlating the logs . For logging I have used Slf4j with logback . In micronaut support for generating TraceId comes quite easily just matter of adding proper dependencies which can be found here https://guides.</description>

      <description>Adoption of microservices architecture is on rising. Teams reap benefits of microservices which enables them to deliver faster, chose a language stack for their choice, quick feedback cycle, etc but, this freedom and pace comes at the cost of complexity to manage a new distributed system which must work in collaboration with each other to deliver the business functionalities. Reliability, fault tolerance, Tracing , Observability are some must-have aspect in a microservice architecture, add to it the functionality of canary deployment, traffic shifting and suddenly there is a whole layer of support system that is required for a service to deliver reliably.</description>

      <description>The technology landscape for developers is changing rapidly. From monolith applications to microservices, from an application deployed on-premise datacenter to cloud platform, also applications deployed on virtualized machines to the containerized environment, the shift is huge. As a developer, it is important to keep up to date with this changing landscape both upgrading oneself as well as looking for a new job. As there are a plethora of technologies and there are always much hype and evangelism around a new technology it is always good to start with a much stable language, framework, and tool.</description>
